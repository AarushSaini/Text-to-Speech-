# Text-to-Speech-
This Python script uses pyttsx3 to convert text to speech with configurable settings for speech rate, volume, and voice type. It features configuration management via a file or environment variables, robust error handling, and detailed logging for professional use. Users can input text to be spoken aloud and exit the program by typing 'exit'.
